Medium Term:

- Viewport support

- Status bar menu/buttons:
    - Explanatory hover text over buttons

        - Tunable: speed vs. bandwidth selection
        - Tunable: CPU use versus latency.
        - shared mode
        - Scaling

    - Keyboard menu:
        - Ctrl Lock, Alt Lock, SysRq Lock
        - Highlight menu icon when keys are locked

Longer Term:

- Implement UI option for VNC shared mode.

- Get web-socket-js RFC2817 proxying working again.

- Implement tight and ZRLE encoding

- Support for Spice protocol.
