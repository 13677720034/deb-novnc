novnc (2012.1~e3+dfsg+1-4) unstable; urgency=low

novnc (2012.1~e3+dfsg+1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a build-depend on python-greenlet. There is no actual need for
    python-greenlet at build time. But on some architectures
    python-greenlet is not yet available and novnc should not try to build
    because the resulting package will fail to install. This workaround
    should not be necessary but the maintainer of python-greenlet has not
    resolved portability issues in months at this time and we cannot
    assume it will be resolved quickly. (Closes: #665893).
